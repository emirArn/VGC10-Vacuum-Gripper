# The dashboard is the only process that knows which scenario is running; the
# ROS2 → Kafka bridge is the only process that writes into the data pipeline.
# This node is the link between them. It publishes the active use-case name,
# and the bridge stamps every document it forwards with whatever it last heard
# (see ros2_kafka_bridge/src/double_ros2_kafka_bridge.py::safe_publish).
#
# TRANSIENT_LOCAL durability is NOT optional. The bridge is a long-lived process
# that can be (re)started at any moment, including in the middle of a run. With
# the default VOLATILE durability it would never see a value published before it
# subscribed, and would silently tag a whole run as IDLE.

# needs: it appends data_acquisition:=true to the HIL launch, which brings up the
# ROS→Kafka bridge. The UR RTDE recorder and the Kafka→Elasticsearch consumers
# were started by hand, in two more terminals, every single time. A pipeline you
# have to remember to start in three places is a pipeline that eventually runs
# with a third of itself missing and nobody notices until the index is queried.
# The switch now owns all three.
#
# These two live on the Desktop, outside this workspace, so the paths are
# overridable from the environment instead of being edited in here when a folder
# moves. Each command's working directory matters and is not decoration:
#   * record_to_kafka.py does sys.path.append("..") to reach the rtde package,
#     so it only imports when run from its own examples/ directory.
#   * run_all.sh globs KafkatoElastic_*.py in the CURRENT directory, so started
#     from anywhere else it silently starts nothing at all.
