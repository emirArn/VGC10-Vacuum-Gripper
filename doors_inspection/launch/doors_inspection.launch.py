"""Execute the doors plan on both arms.

This does NOT re-implement the executors. It includes multirobot_viewpoint_planner's
inspection launch with the doors plan and a doors output tree, so the UR and Kawasaki
nodes, the trajectory cache, the 2*pi unwinding and the nearest-branch IK are exactly
the ones already validated on the chassis job -- and any later fix there lands here too.

Two paths follow the plan file automatically and therefore stay separate from the
chassis job's:
  * the trajectory cache -> doors_inspection/plans/trajectories/
  * the captured clouds  -> <output_base_dir>/{sim,real}_pcds/{ur,kawasaki}_data/

Typical use:
    ros2 launch doors_inspection doors_inspection.launch.py
    ros2 launch doors_inspection doors_inspection.launch.py only_sim:=false
    ros2 launch doors_inspection doors_inspection.launch.py force_replan:=true
